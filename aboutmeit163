- 👋 Hi, I’m Kelly. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design, Travel, Soapmaking and trying to figure out what my feline's Language
- 🌱 I’m currently studeing at Seattle Central College to recieve a certificatre in Web Dersign but believe I can get me AAS with creaditrs from previous universoity. 
- 💞️I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am obsessed with creating an extensive resource collection and always expanding my network. Never know who you are going to meet. I always like to get input as well as give. I think the more the ideas thrown, the more creativity, the more we discover, and it comes through in our work.I am still deciding between UX and UI but leaning toward UX. I hold a degree in Art History, minor in Business, and a former career in Events Management. I feel like I would be well suited for design and to work with clients, but I do enjoy creating the websites with coding and HTML. Maybe a Unicorn, eventually. I am Dyslexic, well managed but it this does come out in my work at times. Always appreciate a heads up on anything major in my coding that will avoid errors.
